Hello world. I have long thought and talked about making a personal website. Not sure why I've put it off for so long. So I am going to document every step to make it super-duper easy for anyone that wants to make a personal website like this. My current plan is that this will be an art portfolio/creative website! Exciting!

Step 0:
Create a repository on GitHub and git clone.

Step 1:
Frantically learn different options for layout. After discussing with friend Emily Hong, I decide on Andrew Fong's Jekyll theme, [Hydeout](https://fongandrew.github.io/hydeout/about). I then [download it](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) from GiHub. Then I tinkered with some of the files for testing. Now I will publish on gh-pages to see results and go from there.
